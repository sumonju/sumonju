- 👋 Hi, I’m @sumonju
- 👀 My full name is Sumon Kanti Das. I have completed my bachelor's from the Department of Geological Sciences at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. 
- I’m interested in researching about issues related to atmospheric sciences. Specifically, I intend to study spatial and temporal variations in global Temperature and Precipitation. In addtion, I intend to research about topics related to climate variability, tropical and sub-tropical climate dynamics. Moreover, I am interested in learning and using my knowledge of Python in data acquisition, data processing, data visualization, GIS and mapping, time series analysis, and numerical modeling. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various libraries and tools for such computations. 
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with domain experts in geophysics, oceanography, and related fields.
