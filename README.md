- 👋 Hi, I'm @sumonju
- 👀 My full name is Sumon Kanti Das. I have completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Geological Sciences at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. 
- I'm interested in researching issues related to paleoclimate and global climate change. Specifically, I intend to study spatial and temporal variations in worldwide Temperature and Precipitation. In addition, I plan to research topics related to the impacts of climate change on biodiversity around the world. Moreover, I am interested in learning and using my knowledge of Python in data acquisition, data processing, data visualization, GIS and mapping, time series analysis, and numerical modelling to reconstruct past climatic changes and predict future climatic conditions. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning various libraries and tools for such computations. 
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with domain experts in climate sciences, climate dynamics, paleoclimate reconstruction, oceanography, and related fields. 
- 📫 You can reach me here: sumon.stu2016@juniv.edu
