- 👋 Hi, I’m @sumonju
- 👀 My full name is Sumon Kanti Das. I have completed my bachelor's from the Department of Geological Sciences at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. 
      I’m interested in researching sea floor and ice sheet movements. In addition, I am interested in learning and using my knowledge of Python in data 
      acquisition, data preprocessing, data visualization, GIS and mapping, time series analysis, and numerical modeling. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various libraries and tools for such computations. 
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with domain experts in geophysics, oceanography, and related fields. 
- 📫 You can reach me here: sumon.stu2016@juniv.edu
